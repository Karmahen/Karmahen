#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--##1. How many locations are there in New York that sold more than 1 product in January?

SELECT count(distinct location)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%' 
AND quantity>1;

--##2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphones%'
Group By product;

--##3. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id;

--##4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id;

--##5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) DESC
Limit 1;
